			CRD Sample Code README

CRD sample code provides several sets of software to read, write, convert, and 
test CRD files. These are provided "as is" with no guarantees. The software has 
been tested with a limited amount of data, and there may still be errors and 
incomplete implementation of standards. This software is meant to be a starting
place for those implementing and managing ranging data in the CRD format.

To avoid confusion that would occur if the terms "new" and "old" format were 
used, the following convention is adopted. References to the CRD format use 
the term "crd". References to the older ILRS normal point and sampled 
engineering (quicklook) format use the term "cstg", reflecting the format's 
origin. Similarly, references to the older ILRS full rate format use the term 
"merit" or "MERIT-II" to reflect the format's origin. Similarly, the lunar
full rate data is refeirred to as "cospar" data.

The CRD sample software can be broken into several groups.

1) Code common to many applications
   directory: common_c	('c' version)
   directory: crd_rw_c
	read_crd.c	- read and parse CRD records
	write_crd.c	- write CRD records
	getfield.c	- read undelimited data fields from a string ???

2) Code common to many applications
   directory: common_f	('FORTRAN' version)
	read_crdf.f	- read and parse CRD records
	write_crdf.f	- write CRD records

3) CRD file checker - crd_chk ('c' only).
   directory: crd_chk_c
	crd_chk.c	 - check CRD file for errors
        crd_cstg_np_cmp  - compares new and old format normal point files for 
                           differences
        crd_merit_fr_cmp - compares new and old format full rate files for 
                           differences

4) Various conversion utilities between CRD and older SLR/LLR formats 
   ('c' only).
   directory: crd_conv_slr_c
	crd_to_cstg_np.c	- CRD normal points to old normal point format
	crd_to_cstg_ql.c	- CRD sampled engineering to old 
				  sampled engineering format
	crd_to_merit.c		- CRD fullrate to old fullrate format
	cstg_to_crd.c		- Old normalpoint and sampled engineering
				  to CRD format
	merit_to_crd.c		- Old fullrate to CRD format
	read_cstg.c		- Read old normalpoint and sampled engineering
				  records
	read_merit.c		- Read old fullrate records
	write_cstg.c		- Write old normalpoint and sampled engineering
				  records
	write_merit.c		- Write old fullrate records

5) Various conversion utilities from old lunar format to CRD ('c' only).
   directory: crd_conv_llr_c
	cllr_to_crd.c		- Old COSPAR lunar to CRD format
	read_llr.c		- Read old lunar format records
	cospar_llr.h		- Header file with old lunar format information

6) Various CRD file split, merge, sort, and miscellaneous routines.
   directory: crd_split_c
	crd_split.c		- Split multi-pass and multi-data-type file
				  into separate files using station naming
				  convention ????
	frd_strip.c		- Strip out station-dependent (9x) records and
				  remove some white space from CRD fullrate file
	merge_crd_daily.c	- merge single pass normalpoitn, quicklook, and
				  full rate files into single day files.

7) Various header and include files
   directory: include	('c' and FORTRAN versions)
	crd.h			- Header file with CRD information ('c')
	crd.inc			- Header file with CRD information (FORTRAN)
	cstg.h			- Header file with old normal point and
				  sampled engineering information
	merit.h			- Header file with old fullrate format 
				  information
8) Convert between v1 and v2 of the CRD format. V1 in -> V2 out. 
   V2 in -> V1 out.
   directory: crd_conv_v1v2
	crd_conv.c		- convert between formats
	crd_create.c		- Creates complete version 2 files from
                                  version 1, selecting only specified stations
                                  and converting to a new SIC (for ASC testing).
	create.dat*		- files for specific output from crd_create.


To compile this code on a Linux system, just type
        ./make.sh clean
	./make.sh
on the command line in the main directory or
	make all
in each source directory.

In selected directories there are scripts to test the program using the 
supplied data. Data files ending in ".ref" are the reference (or "correct") 
output from the conversion programs. To run the tests, and automatically 
compared results, type
	./test.sh
in the main directory or each of these directories.

If there are errors or problems found with the software, please let me know.
Thank you.
