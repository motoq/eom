Misc
----

Check defaults for derived

Add oe input type for orbits

Add radians support for inputting oe and ground points

Add dd:mm:ss support for ground points

List files generated

Check if rel and eph orbits need to be added to eomx_simulation_time

Create orbital elements factory for different edge case orbits (e.g.,
zero eccentricity, etc).

Indicate directory to locate .emb files

Move as much functionality outside of classes (when internals to a class
are not needed).

Review use of initialization at declaration and within constructor

Order of init = order of declaration

Add default constructors

Remove Printable and move to traditional ostream friend operator

Access
------

Use generalized orbital elements for validation orbit
