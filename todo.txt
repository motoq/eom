TLE checksum warning (not error)

Default step size for 0 integration Duration

Remove Duration for GJ and GJs unless intent is to add this as an
option.

use move for ecfeci in orbit builder functions

geo orbit def

Better accessibility of celestial ephemerides for commands (possibly
just reload as necessary).  astro_generate switches to Meeus' methods
for now.

snprintf() check

Document azimuth is clockwise from north, 0 to 360

Add doc on needing to update number of potential items to loop over

Populate TLE in OrbitDef when initialized with non-tle

Document access analysis.

Document TLE/SGP4 inputs

Document reading of SLR sites when finished

When creating ecfeci_sys in eomx.cpp, pull ecfeci_sys out of bracket

Return number of messages from ecfeci_sys that were atually created

Does a zero Duration break ECFECI generation?

Rename LeapSecond.setUtc_Ut1 to setUtcMinuxUt1
setTai_Utc

Check defaults for derived

Add oe input type for orbits

Add radians support for inputting oe and ground points

Add dd:mm:ss support for ground points

List files generated

Check if rel and eph orbits need to be added to eomx_simulation_time

Create orbital elements factory for different edge case orbits (e.g.,
zero eccentricity, etc).

Indicate directory to locate .emb files

Move as much functionality outside of classes (when internals to a class
are not needed).

Review use of initialization at declaration and within constructor

Order of init = order of declaration

Add default constructors

What default ECI frame to use for orbital elements


Access
------

Use generalized orbital elements for validation orbit
